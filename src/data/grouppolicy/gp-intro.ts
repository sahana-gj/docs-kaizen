# Introduction to Group Policy

Group Policy is a Windows feature that provides centralized management and configuration of operating systems, applications, and user settings in an Active Directory environment.

## What is Group Policy?

Group Policy allows administrators to implement specific configurations for users and computers throughout an Active Directory domain. It provides:

- **Centralized Management**: Configure settings from a central location
- **Scalability**: Apply settings to thousands of users and computers
- **Security**: Enforce security policies across the organization
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform configurations across systems

### Group Policy Objects (GPOs)

GPOs are collections of policy settings that can be applied to:
- **Users**: Control user environment and restrictions
- **Computers**: Configure computer settings and security
- **Organizational Units**: Apply policies to specific groups

## Key Components

1. **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)** – Administrative interface for managing GPOs
2. **Group Policy Editor** – Tool for configuring policy settings
3. **Administrative Templates** – Registry-based policy settings
4. **Security Settings** – Password policies, account lockout policies, and more

### Common Use Cases

- **Password Policies**: Enforce strong password requirements
- **Software Installation**: Deploy applications automatically
- **Desktop Configuration**: Standardize desktop appearance and functionality
- **Security Settings**: Configure firewall and security options
